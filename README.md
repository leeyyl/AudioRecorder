## Additional Notes

### Permissions

The app requires permissions to access the device’s microphone. When you run the app, it will prompt you to grant the necessary permissions.

In development, this is handled automatically by Expo. However, for production, make sure you configure app permissions in app.json:

```
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription": "$(PRODUCT_NAME) needs access to your Microphone."
      }
    },
    "android": {
      "permissions": [
        "android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"
      ]
    },
  }
}
```

### Main Components

Here’s a brief overview of the main components used in the app:

- Record Component - **_Memo.tsx_**
- Playback Component - **_MemoItem.tsx_**

## Note

- The app was developed and tested using the Expo SDK. If you plan to eject from Expo, additional configuration may be required.
- Ensure your device has sufficient storage and proper microphone functioning capability to avoid any interruptions.
